PyCon China is an Annual meeting of Python, which licensed by PyCon and hosted by CPyUG(Chinese Python User Group). In the past 7 years, it has successfully held more than 20 times in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Xi'an and Hefei.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The  8th China Python Developers Conference PyCon China 2018 is sponsored by PyChina.org, organized by 30 organizers from CPyUG / TopGeek and nearly 150 volunteers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Chengdu. It will commit to  the development and application of various Python-related technologies in the fields of Internet and enterprise applications. </p>\n<p>With the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence, Python brings huge opportunities to developers.</p>\n<p>Each Pythoner has their own PyCon conference in mind, and the organizing committee of the conference is also working on a conference that will help Pythoner. So this year \u2014\u2014 in the 8th year of PyCon China, we will break the past conventions and welcome all developers who are committed to promoting Python technology to join our organizing committee, lecturers, and volunteers. Together with the famous Python experts and enthusiastic Python promotion ambassadors to promote the Python language and its latest applications to the whole society. Let us work together to make the PyCon conference become an big party of gathering and sharing of experiences and achievements for pythoners once a year.</p>\n<p>The main venue of PyCon China 2018 is located in Beijing, because Beijing is the most concentrated city of Pythoners. We will try our best to meet the demands of Pythoners in various fields with the main venue of thousand people summit in the morning and the 5-6 breakout venue in the afternoon. At the same time, the Python special session for women was opened for the first time under the advice of Beijing core organizer Zheao Lee. </p>\n<p>Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Chendu are the breakout venues. We will coordinate and arrange the specific sharing schedules according to the application situation of subject, the willingness of everyone to participate, and the local characteristics.</p>\n<p>In the case where the lecturer and the venue are mature, we welcome Pyhoners from other regions to launch the PyCon conference, in order to making more Pythoners talk and share together, and making more people understand, recognize, use Python and become experts. </p>\n",

No, Since it is a conference about Python, we will return to the essence of the language .We will talk about the industrial application of the new features in new versions of Python and  the solutions of  Python multi-version, multi-environment coexistence that plague many development and operations engineers. Inspire interest and hit the pain point.</p>\n<p>Having said that much, here comes the three major philosophical questions :when and where, how to sign up? (Who am I? Where am I from? Where will I go?)</p>\n<p>The event will be held on October 21st, 2018 (Sunday), let us meet at the 2nd floor of No.1 Art Hotel.

In 1981, the discipline Computer and Its Applications was authorized as one of the first disciplines in China being able to award master degree, when there was only two in Sichuan Province. The department Computer Science and Engineering was founded in 1981, which was followed by the establishment of the School of Computer and Communications Engineering (SCCE) in 1993 (the predecessor of SIST). In 2005, the school was renamed SIST. With the solid construction and rapid development over 50 years, SIST has built a balanced and well developed disciplinary system, covering the whole area of Electronics and Information. With primary disciplines including Computer, Communications, Control and Electronics, SIST has become a base for producing IT talents and carrying out outstanding scientific research.",
