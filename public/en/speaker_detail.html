      Python is a programming language with multiple inheritance capabilities. In object-oriented inheritance, the invocation of methods is closely related to the order of inheritance. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to calculate the MRO as the only criterion for the method call sequence, and understanding MRO can help us in Python object-oriented programming.

      The development of Web technology has been quite complicated so far. The related projects are “small and no internal, and they are nothing short”. Various front and rear end frames and middlewares are numerous and numerous. Many introductory developers have even worked for three or five years, limited to the use of a certain two frameworks, and regarded their own fancy framework as a standard. They are only skilled in the interface after the framework is packaged. Why does the framework exist and why in that design? When encountering difficult problems, and how to solve and optimize, it is not enough. This topic is based on the history of Web technology development, helping listeners to clearly understand the role and key points of Web-related core technologies, so that they can have clear goals and clear ideas when solving various problems encountered in learning work in the future.

      AI is math. Though we do not have to prove something mathematically when creating a deep neuro network, we are using statistical methods to learn the patterns from the data. Unsurprisingly, we've done some unseen assumption behind the model that will never lead to the result that an intelligence could understand and generalize about the world. Today we are going to discuss about the limitations of machine intelligence based on some real world projects, from image recognition to natural language processing, about both data and models. </br>
</br>
To python players, this talk may answer the following questions:</br>
1. How to know whether my problem can be solved by Artificial Intelligence today? </br>
2. How to design the indictors for a real-life problem? </br>
3. How to know if a model is 'good enough'? </br>

      Why is the length of the object being len() instead of obj.length() ? What is the difference between an iterator and an iterable object? Why do we rarely use design patterns when writing Python code? Behind this it is the idea of "protocol" in the Python language. This talk will discuss how to understand the protocol in Python, what is the design idea, and how to write Python code to implement this idea.

      The topic of my speech is about the comparison between a non-Pythonic way and a Pythonic way of approaching business problems. As I switched from a business side to a technical field, I have experienced how two sides differ in solving business problems. I will cover the actual problems needed to be solved on FC Network Analysis using K-Means and how pro Excel users would approach this problem.
